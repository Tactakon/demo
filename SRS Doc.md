# **1. Introduction**
---
## **1.1 Purpose**
---
The purpose of this document is to describe the implementation details and objectives of our upcoming collaborative DJing app - Verge.

## **1.2 Intended Audiemce**
---
The audience of this document is our team members, including Kirstyn Fagnani, Kinjal Rele, Derrick Hood, and John Bergin, as well as our instructor for CSC 4351 - Professor John Martin. 
## **1.3 Intended Use**
---
This document will allow our team to align with the work that needs to be completed with this project. With this document, we intend to refer back to it and ensure we are on task and have completed the original scope. This includes items like the design, brainstorming of features, planning durations, and measuring what can be accomplished in the amount of time we have. We will use this document to guide the future of our product while staying aligned with our initial ideas. 
## **1.4 Scope**
---
Verge is a seamless collaborative DJ experience that lets listeners control the music. DJs can instantly accept and relinquish control of the mix without missing a beat. As a listener, you can request your favorite song, and the DJ will see it. Whether you are a professional DJ, a weekend hobbyist, or just someone who enjoys good tunes, Verge lets everyone play a part in the mix.
<br><br>
Some features that define our product:
- Create, browse, share, and listen to playlists. 
- Your playlist can be locked or unlocked. Totally up to you what playlist you want to make public.
- If you give access to another user, they can add songs to your playlists. This requires a passcode.
- If a DJ plays live (in-person or virtually), you can quickly scan their QR code to request songs.
- As a DJ, you can set a genre before you start mixing. Songs requested that do not match the vibe will be automatically denied.
<br><br>

Many apps on the market allow DJs to mix electronically, but we have found none that incorporate the experience we intend to. We intend to create a space where listeners can connect with their favorite DJs easily and where DJs can share their premade playlist or their music in real time. Think of a mix between Spotify, Twitch, and Social Media. We hope that Verge will allow DJs and Listeners to have a meaningful experience on both ends.
